# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock - Java

The simple Rock Paper Scissors game expanded with two more symbols, Lizard and Spock.

- This version of the game uses a somewhat 'smarter' Computer player, which uses the frequencies of symbols used by the Human player to generate a response symbol that would be able to 
beat the most likely human symbol. Also includes functionality of allowing Two Computer players to play against each other.
